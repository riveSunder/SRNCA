    "Occasionally, or frequently as the case may be, you may want to include mathematical expressions in a project page on gh-pages or on a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered blog in general. Luckily, Markdown allows you to easily include math using LaTeX format by denoting the text with `$$`.\n",

    "Unluckily the Kramdown flavor of Markdown favored by Jekyll does not support LaTeX equations, so you'll only see the unrendered LaTeX code if you try to include it in a gh-pages page using Kramdown and Jekyll. We could instead render LaTeX equations in a Jupyter notebook, save the screenshots, and include the screenshots as images in the page, but the results can be inconsistent and it can be a bit tedious besides.\n",
