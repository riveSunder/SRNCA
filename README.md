# SRNCA 
## Symbolic regression with inductive biases from neural cellular automata
## This project was designed to use texture training to emulate variegation patterns. It uses symbolic regression to approximate the learned functions found with the CA with mathematical functions, in hopes of finding some interesting patterns. 

### To set it up:
### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/riveSunder/SRNCA.git

### Create a virtual environment:

virtualenv my_env --python=python3
##### (or this if it doesn't work?): 
python3 -m venv my_env

### Install the dependancies using the requirements text file:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### From this, you should be able to run the notebooks. (How?)
